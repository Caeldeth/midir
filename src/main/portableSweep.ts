// Remove the unpack folders that killed portable launches left in %TEMP%.
//
// The portable exe is an NSIS stub. It unpacks the app into its own
// `%TEMP%\ns*.tmp` folder, runs it with `ExecWait`, and deletes that folder when
// the app exits. It cleans up after a normal close, after a second launch that
// loses the single-instance lock, and after the app crashes or is killed —
// measured on oghma's own exe, 2026-09-27, because the stub is still waiting on
// the app in all three cases.
//
// **If the STUB itself is killed, nothing runs its `RMDir`.** The folder stays
// under a random name that no later launch reuses, holding the package and the
// scratch the extraction wrote. Midir does not set `portable.unpackDirName`, so
// the app folder inside it has a fixed build-time name that the next launch
// reclaims; the package and the scratch do not, and they are the leak.
//
// So a portable launch sweeps what earlier launches left. Each rule below is
// part of the safety case, which is why none of them is a shortcut:
//
//   - Only as the portable exe, and only when this process can find its OWN
//     unpack folder. A process that cannot identify itself cannot be sure it is
//     not about to delete itself, so it does nothing.
//   - Only `ns*.tmp` folders that hold `app\<our exe>` and
//     `app\resources\app.asar`. Another app's leftovers are not ours to delete.
//   - Only folders older than `MIN_AGE_MS`. A second launch unpacks for seconds
//     before anything in its folder is locked.
//   - RENAME first, then delete. Windows refuses to rename a folder while a
//     running app's exe is mapped from it (EBUSY) or its stub holds it (EPERM),
//     measured on the real exe. A refused rename means "in use", and the folder
//     is skipped. Deleting straight away would half-delete a running copy.
//
// It runs in the background after boot and never throws: a sweep that fails
// costs disk space, not a working app.
//
// **In Electron, pass `original-fs`, never the patched `fs`.** Electron's `fs`
// treats any path ending in `app.asar` as an archive: touching a leftover's
// `app.asar` opens it and caches the handle, and Windows then refuses the
// rename because this process holds the file. Oghma's first packaged build of
// this sweep skipped every real leftover as "in use" for that reason, while
// every unit test passed under plain Node, which has no asar patch. The
// signature check below reads directory listings only, so it never opens
// `app.asar` even under the patched `fs` (HTOO-494).
